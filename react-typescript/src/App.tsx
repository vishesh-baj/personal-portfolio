  // personlist object is specified for the database required fovr the upscale model of the whne i was done dying my conscience regained so i begin my strufggle anf nothingness strained out of flash made of time my new form blasted out and it started me so and I burst out a shout at which wmy legs went frantic like bugs from a nest and I ran untill drained leaving no chouce but rest so I fell asleep softly at the wdge of a cave but I shouldve gone deeper but I am not so brave I Say hey yaa yaa hey yaa yaa hey, I woke up to see that theres two mighty steads wth their moughts chirning wildly expressing my deeds, as they put my head over and laid down to file I dont need to fear there's nothing to hide.
